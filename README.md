# Gilad C# WindowsForms Controllers

Custom C# WindowsForms UI Controllers/Components which allows you to use within the designer in Visual Studio.


## Description

Started a little project of controllers in the designer of C# WindowsForms application to keep code clean and not
fill the MainForm full of code just because of wanting to override some of the functions of the build in C# Controllers.
It's really simple to use and pretty straight forward as soon as you'll see the gif images previews.
